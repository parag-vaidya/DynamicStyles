# DynamicStyles
This demonstrats the use of dynamic styles in React Native

## Dependencies
Here I am using [MomentJs](http://momentjs.com/), to display the days. To install the MomentJs as library use following command
```
npm install --save moment
```
## How to Run
I am using [Genymotion](https://www.genymotion.com/) to run this. 
To run this example, first make sure that genymotion android emulator is running, then go into DynamicStyles folder and execute following set of command
```
react-native start
```
It will start the node server. Then open another command window, go into DynamicStyles folder and execute following command.
```
react-native run-android
```
